Description:
------------
This file is the README file of the bb-keylogger project.

This is a very small project developped in order to offer the possibility to people to log informations about their computer.

I made it because I wanted a program able to help me to track my laptop in case of theft.

This program is able to log in a file these informations :
- the name of the computer
- the time of the system (when the program is started)
- the user who is logged (when the program is started)
- the keystrokes (since the program has been started)

Wiki :

See the wiki for more details about the keystrokes and the log file.
In addition there's a wiki page explaining you HOW TO install the keylogger.
