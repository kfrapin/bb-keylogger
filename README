Description:

This file is the README file of the bb-keylogger project.

This is a very small project developped in order to offer the possibility to people to log informations about their computer.

I made it because I wanted a program able to help me to track my laptop in case of theft.

This program is able to log in a file these informations :
- the name of the computer
- the time of the system (when the program is started)
- the user who is logged (when the program is started)
- the keystrokes (since the program has been started)

In an other file (coming soon...) I'll explain how to use it, if you want to "protect" you from thieves.

If you have any suggestions, or remarks, you can contact me:
